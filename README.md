# GANs-tf
Generative Adversarial Networks implemented in Tensorflow on Colab Notebooks. These were developed for my understanding and learning during my internship(s). This is meant for my tutorial purpose. Knowledge from these implementation were used elsewhere. 

For files where no dataset is mentioned in the notebook name, it is mostly for MNIST.
