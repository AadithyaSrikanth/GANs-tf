# GANs-tf
Generative Adversarial Networks implemented in Tensorflow on Colab Notebooks. These were developed for my understanding and learning during my internship(s). This is meant for my tutorial purpose only. Hence, the generated images may not be the best. Hyper-parameters may not further tuning.  

Knowledge from these implementations were used elsewhere. 

For files where no dataset is mentioned in the notebook name, it is mostly for MNIST.
